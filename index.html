Affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), we’re a day boarding and residential school. Our 17-acre campus consisting of the best infrastructure, technology and faculty, is located just 12km from Hisar on the Hisar-Sirsa Road.<br><br>St. Joseph’s has welcomed students from all backgrounds. We encourage  students to nurture their talents and to create relationships that are bound to last a lifetime. From Nursery to 12th Standard, we have a full enrollment capacity of 2,500 students.<br><br>We provide full-boarding facilities of the highest standard for students to make them feel at home. Our GPS equipped buses ensure that each child staying in localities of Hisar or nearby towns has a safe mode of transportation to- and from the campus.<br><br>At St. Joseph’s, we aim to create an environment where each child feels welcomed and encouraged. We’re a multicultural school that aims to form habits that will serve them even after their time with us. By taking individual and collective responsibility of the children under our care, we hope to create an environment where every child feels like learning.
